# Data Viz with D3
A repo for tracking progress as I work through [newline's D3 Masterclass](https://www.newline.co/courses/fullstack-d3-masterclass).

### Lesson 1: Drawing a Line Chart
- Walked through the basics of d3. This included using accessor functions to access falues and pass as callbacks; selecting and appending to the dom with d3; creating the layout for a chart, including setting a domain, range, bounds, and scale; learning the basics of using svgs within d3 to draw paths and shapes.

### Lesson 2: Drawing a Scatter Chart
- Solidifying principals started in Lesson 1. Taking a deeper look the process of setting up
a d3 data viz: accessing data, creating dimensions, drawing canvas and wrapper, creating scales, drawing data, drawing peripherals, adding interactions.
